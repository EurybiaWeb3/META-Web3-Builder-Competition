Project Name: Matrix World

Project Intro:

Matrix World is an innovative, multichain metaverse that aims to overcome the shortcomings present in current metaverse offerings and provide a superior experience for both users and creators. Our project currently supports two blockchain networks, Ethereum and Flow, with a plan to support more networks in the pipeline.

Matrix World's multichain technology facilitates the maintenance of identities across several blockchains, allowing users and creators from various ecosystems to converge seamlessly in one place. This interoperability allows collaboration and interaction among separate blockchain ecosystems by breaking down the barriers between them, benefiting both users and creators. The system currently supports Ethereum and Flow, but is designed to be extensible, which allows our team to easily incorporate additional blockchains, such as Immutable. 

Matrix World is designed with a broad audience in mind, requiring no prior knowledge of web3 or development for users to enjoy the world or develop their land. To achieve this, we have embraced a frictionless design philosophy that simplifies the user experience, making it effortless for non-web3 users to enter our metaverse and explore. Examples include our streamlined entry flow and the ability for new users to register and generate a wallet with just a few clicks and an email address, with no seedphrases or downloads required. Our overarching goal is to create a metaverse experience that is inclusive and accessible to all. By implementing a frictionless design philosophy, we aim to broaden the adoption of blockchain technology and welcome a wide range of users to Matrix World.

Matrix World is introducing Instanced Spaces built inside the Metaverse. Walkable areas are no more a limitation. With Instanced Spaces, we will support amazing custom built 2D/3D projects, games and dApps without having limitations on computation resources. Developers can build their games using their favourite frameworks such as Babylon.js, Unity, and host them inside MatrixWorlds. We will offer opensource SDKs and tools to make this possible. This will allow developers to host their own games on the web and host them inside MatrixWorlds, so developers can enjoy the whole community support from MatrixWorlds. Instanced Spaces will be supported starting Q4 2023. Matrix World will support IMX games (browser-based) accessible via our 3D metaverse, making MatrixWorld the hub of multichain games and experiences. (ref: https://imgur.com/mMdfK77)
