Project Name: Riff

Project Intro: Riff is a complete smart contract development helper toolkit that lets developers analyse, test, send transactions, collaborate, and document smart contracts. Our goal is to aggregate all tools which help in smart contract development and present them to developers with the simplest UX. Our magic elements are sending of contract transaction request links, gasless testing of contracts for all teams of an organisation, autogeneration of code for unit tests and documentation based on a graphical testing interface, and analytics suite based on indexed transactions for smart contracts with notification triggers for orgs.
We have a POC (https://getriff.xyz) ready with early analytics and sending transaction capabilities. Our following goals are to improve UI and further research our magic features while we build a talented team to help us develop the complete product.

We have also launched a Riff safety analytics snap. It's the ultimate tool for safe and secure transactions on the blockchain. Given below is the description of the snap:

It shows important insights like:

- The number of previous transactions on the address.
- The functions that have been called with the smart contract.
- The top addresses that interact with the address.
- Function-specific gas analytics for the smart contract being transacted to.

It helps in the following ways:

- By using information like the number of previous transactions on the address, one can quickly assess the reputation of the address you're interacting with.
- Another essential feature is the ability to see the functions that have been called with the smart contract. This allows one to see exactly how the contract is being used and whether it has any potential red flags.
- The top addresses that interact with the contract/address are also crucial information. This allows one to see who else is interacting with the address and whether they have a good reputation.
