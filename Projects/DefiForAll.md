Project Name: Defi For All

Project Intro: This project a standalone DeFi WebApp for retail users that is not associated with the Polygon brand, with the following goals:

Increase the number of new retail users engaging with Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem (i.e. greater awareness and / or usage) by providing a seamless user experience. Generate valuable usage data (e.g. funnel conversion, dropoff rates, deposits / withdrawals, fiat on-ramp usage) and UI / UX product insights from user feedback (qualitative / interviews) that can be shared with DeFi dApps across Polygon’s ecosystem to achieve broad-based improvements in user experience. Potentially serve as a first point of interaction and launchpad into Polygon’s broader DeFi ecosystem for new retail users.
