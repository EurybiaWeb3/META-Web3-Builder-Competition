Project Name: Minhub

Project Intro: ```MinHub is a one-stop service for all NFT creators. MinHub allows you to generate and deploy an ERC721 contract on the Scroll blockchain with any information and features. After the deployment, you can use mint button for integration, with which anyone can mint your NFT collection. 
We saw how rapidly the NFT community on the Scroll blockchain is developing and decided to release MinHub on Scroll to make it easier for creators to go from the idea of a collection to its implementation.```
