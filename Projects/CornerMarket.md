Project Name: CornerMarket

Project Intro: CornerMarket is a Web3 shopping and payments ecosystem built on Polygon and BNB Chain, which is designed to enable small businesses to seamlessly connect with customers and build thriving local communities.
The platform provides merchants with tools to create personalized deals, rewards, and incentives for customers, leveraging blockchain technology to securely tokenize them into NFTs. This fosters customer loyalty while ensuring transparency.
A key feature is the crypto payment system, which allows customers to pay with major cryptocurrencies and frees merchants from costly credit card processing fees. Merchants get paid out in stablecoins without volatility, settlement, or custody concerns.
For customers, CornerMarket introduces paradigm shifts like phone numbers and social media login, removing the need to navigate crypto wallets and seed phrases. It also covers gas fees so transacting feels like Web2. The platform also launched a refer-to-earn model that incentivizes user acquisition through rewards.
By leveraging blockchain technology, CornerMarket establishes direct merchant-consumer connections, saves on costs, and accelerates mainstream Web3 adoption. The mobile app is now available on iOS and Android.
CornerMarket represents the last mile of cryptocurrency adoption in daily life. With an easy-to-use interface and focus on real-world utility, CornerMarket unlocks the next wave of cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption in payments, shopping, and daily life.
