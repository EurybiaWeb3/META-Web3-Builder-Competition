Project Name: EventCrib

Project Intro:
EventCrib is a decentralized event management and ticketing platform for event managers and event planners. EventCrib is all about Digitizing and Decentralizing Event Management for event planners.
This platform will enable users to be able to buy event tickets and get NFTs which will serve as pass for events. Event managers and planners will be able to plan any kind of event using our platform, a Todo list, creating events and issuing NFTs, campaigns etc. We intend to make it really robustic for event planners such that they will be able to have everything they would want to plan for their events.
