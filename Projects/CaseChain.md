Project Name: CaseChain

Project Intro: CaseChain is a blockchain-based evidence management system to prevent manipulation in courts. Users can add evidence to this decentralized application for any case number. Since blockchain technology is used, once the data has been successfully uploaded to the blockchain network, it cannot be modified. As a result, a digital trail is made that links the gathering of evidence at the crime scene to the courtroom.
