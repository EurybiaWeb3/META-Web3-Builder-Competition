Project Name: Branchclash

Project Intro: BranchClash is a fully on-chain tower defense game deployed on multiple chains. It introduces chain collaboration, a unique game mechanism inspired by blockchain technology that is not economically centered. BranchClash aims to break away from the entrenched Playto-Earn (P2E) game mechanics in the blockchain gaming market and explore gameplay exclusive to blockchain. As an entirely on-chain game, anyone can play it solely through smart contracts, and we also offer a graphical interface at www.branchclash.com for you to enjoy.
