Project Name: Code Sage

Project Intro: Code Sage is an innovative development tool plugin designed to enhance software development with intelligent assistance. It offers functions like code commenting, code optimization, and bug detection. Recently, we fine-tuned the LLM for dApp development scenarios to generate better code or provide good advice for web3 developments. Code Sage can generate smart contracts and dApp code based on users' descriptions.
